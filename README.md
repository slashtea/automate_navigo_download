# Automate Downloading Navigo Certificate

## How it works ?
* It is exhausting to download every month a navigo (paris public transportation pass subscription) to send it to your employer. This basic script downloads it and renames to a convenient name so that you don't have to do it manually.

## Configuration
* There are very few things to configure in the script, these are commented in the py scirpt. Nevetherless
	* Your **email** address used to subscribe to Navigo
	* **Password** encoded in **base64**
	* Your **first name** and **last name**
	* **Default path of your downloads**
	* Optional path to move file from **Downloads** to another custom path
